# [Breaking Bad Cast](https://shehroze-1122.github.io/breaking-bad-cast/)

App build with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This web app is build using the react framework and utilizes an [Breaking Bad API](https://breakingbadapi.com/documentation) to fetch all the characters' images along with all the details and displays them with cool effects, user-friendly UI.

You can search characters by their name or nickname in the season by either typing or saying it to do so for you. However voice search feature is currently supported only for Google Chrome Browsers.
